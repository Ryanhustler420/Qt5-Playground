https://wiki.qt.io/How_to_setup_Qt_and_openCV_on_Windows

1. Download the openCV
2. Extract To Any Drive
4. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69232278/c-protocol-buffer-temporary-of-non-literal-type-googleprotobufinternal
3. Use CMake Gui to compile the source to opencv-build/ folder
SET THESE PATHS:
	check pic
4. Go to opencv-build/ folder and run command
5. run mingw32-make.exe -j 4
6. run mingw32-make.exe install

7. Open Qt Application & Create an App
8. Add Extranal Library > 
	library: C:\opencv\build\x64\vc15\lib\opencv_world460d.lib
	includes: C:\opencv\build\include

9. Add these libs:
	LIBS += C:/opencv-build/bin/libopencv_core460.dll
	LIBS += C:/opencv-build/bin/libopencv_highgui460.dll
	LIBS += C:/opencv-build/bin/libopencv_imgcodecs460.dll
	LIBS += C:/opencv-build/bin/libopencv_imgproc460.dll
	LIBS += C:/opencv-build/bin/libopencv_features2d460.dll
	LIBS += C:/opencv-build/bin/libopencv_calib3d460.dll

10. It should look like these:
	win32:CONFIG(release, debug|release): LIBS += -LC:/opencv/build/x64/vc15/lib/ -lopencv_world460
	else:win32:CONFIG(debug, debug|release): LIBS += -LC:/opencv/build/x64/vc15/lib/ -lopencv_world460d
	else:unix: LIBS += -LC:/opencv/build/x64/vc15/lib/ -lopencv_world460

	INCLUDEPATH += C:/opencv/build/include
	DEPENDPATH += C:/opencv/build/include

	# We need these below lines because opencv/build only has .h files only so we need the source
	# and in order to get these you need to extract the opencv/sources to opencv-build/

	LIBS += C:/opencv-build/bin/libopencv_core460.dll
	LIBS += C:/opencv-build/bin/libopencv_highgui460.dll
	LIBS += C:/opencv-build/bin/libopencv_imgcodecs460.dll
	LIBS += C:/opencv-build/bin/libopencv_imgproc460.dll
	LIBS += C:/opencv-build/bin/libopencv_features2d460.dll
	LIBS += C:/opencv-build/bin/libopencv_calib3d460.dll

11. Paste all .dll 
	from C:\opencv-build\install\x64\mingw\bin 
	to D:\QtCodes\Practice\build-OpenCV-Desktop_Qt_5_15_2_MinGW_64_bit-Debug

	- also make sure you paste these to release/ as well else it will not work
	- this might not work in GuiApplication, but QApplication
